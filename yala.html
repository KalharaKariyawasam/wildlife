                            <p class="para1">The Veheragala National Park, also known as Yala Block 5 became popular in the last 6 years as an alternative to Yala Block 5. The small land extends borders to the giant Veheragala reservoir and is less visited than its more famous counterpart. This park is also known for its fair number of leopards, often seen on the main road which runs through the park.</p>
                            <p class="para1"> The high density of prey animals such as Spotted Deer and Grey Langur may have resulted in the number of leopards seen, and gradual habituation has helped greatly in giving quality sightings. This is a great park to combine with when visiting Block 1 to get away from crowds and to get a change in landscape.</p>
