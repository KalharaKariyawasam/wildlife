        "content": "Wilpattu National Park is the largest and oldest of its kind in Sri Lanka. Located in the dry zone of the northwestern coast of the country, Wilpattu is world renowned for its leopard and sloth bear population. The highlight of the park – which gives the park its name – is the existence of several “natural lakes” – also known as ‘villus’ (sand-rimmed depressions that fill up with rainwater).\n\nWilpattu in Sinhala means “natural lakes”\n\nWilpattu in Tamil means “ten lakes”\n\nThroughout the park, a total of about 60 natural lakes are found. Most animals and birds use these ‘villus’ as their breeding grounds, hence wherever you spot the lakes, there is a high chance of animals being spotted around there. Although Wilpattu is the largest national park in Sri Lanka, it is not the most visited one. Hence the animal sighting probabilities are slightly less but on the flip side, the park has a more genuine sense of wilderness due to the fewer visitors. Dedicated safari goers will definitely enjoy the Wilpattu wildlife experience."

        "title": "Things to know about Wilpattu National Park before you visit",
        "content": "The park was established in 1905 as a wildlife sanctuary and in December 1938, National Park status was awarded. Due to security reasons during the ongoing civil war, Wilpattu National Park remained closed from December 1988 to March 2003. Currently, visitor access is only limited to about 25% of the park because the remaining area is dense forestation and scrubs.\n\nIn 2015, a survey was conducted by the Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust to monitor the animal species. During a span of four months, 49 individual leopards were recorded and photographed. As a result, Wilpattu gained its world-renowned status for its leopard population."

        "title": "What is the best time to visit Wilpattu National Park?",
        "content": "Because of its location in the dry zone, average temperatures at Wilpattu are centered at approximately 27 degrees Celsius while the average rainfall in the area is about 1000mm. With the dense forestation and beautiful lakes around the park, it hardly feels “dry”. One of the main reasons for this pleasant weather is the pattern of rainfall received in this region (from the 2 monsoons). September to December is when the northeast monsoon falls on Wilpattu and this is the rainiest time of the year. The inter-monsoon season is in between March and April and the drought period occurs from May to early September.\n\nAs mentioned before, the shallow rainwater-filled lakes found at Wilpattu are the park’s special feature. These lakes vary in size from 2 to 400 hectares and are scattered throughout the park. “Periya Vila” is what the biggest of these lakes are called."
